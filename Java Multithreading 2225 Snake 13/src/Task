
Snake 13

I suggest you write a special sleep () method this time.
Which will pause depending on the length of the snake (the number of elements in sections).
Come up with some tricky algorithm. So that at the first level, the pause was 500 milliseconds,
and to level 10 it gradually decreased to 300.
And below 200 did not fall.
